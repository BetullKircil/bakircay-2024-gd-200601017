In this project, objects are generated on the stage at the beginning of the game and only one of the objects can be taken to the circular area. When another object is wanted to be taken, that object is thrown.

## ðŸŽ® BakÄ±rÃ§ay University - Fall 2024 3D Matching Game
Welcome to the 3D Matching Game! Developed as part of my coursework at BakÄ±rÃ§ay University, this project showcases my journey into game development with Unity. The aim was to explore 3D object interaction mechanics while creating an engaging and functional game experience.

## ðŸ›  Midterm Progress Summary
By the midterm evaluation, the game mechanics were fully functional, and the groundwork for further enhancements was solidified.

## ðŸš§ Completed Features
1. Game Environment Setup
Created a vibrant game area with randomly scattered 3D objects.
Designed a placement zone at the bottom of the screen, guiding players to drop objects into their designated spots.
2. Interactive Gameplay
Enabled intuitive object selection and drag mechanics using mouse or touchscreen controls.
Implemented logic to ensure only one object occupies the placement zone at any time. If a new object enters, the existing one is removed.
3. Visual Enhancements
Added dynamic lighting effects to highlight the placement zone and improve the game's aesthetic appeal.
## ðŸŽ® How to Play
Explore the game area and choose a 3D object.
Drag the object using your mouse or touchscreen controls.
Drop the object into the placement zone.
Maintain the rule: Only one object can remain in the zone!
